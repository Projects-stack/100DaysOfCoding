// AVL Tree :
/*      AVL Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree in which each node maintains extra information called balance factor
    whose value is either -1, 0 or +1.

    Balance Factor :
            Balance factor of a node in an AVL tree is the difference between height of the left subtree and that of right subtree of that node.

            Balance Factor = (Height of left subtree - Height of right subtree)
                              or
                             (Height of right subtree - Height of left subtree)

            The self balancing property of AVL tree is maintained by the balance factor. The value of balance factor should always be -1, 0 or +1.

    Operations on an AVL tree :

            Various operations that can be performed on an AVL tree are:
                ->Rotating the subtrees in an AVL Tree
                ->In rotation operation, the positions of the nodes of a subtree are interchanged.

            There are two types of rotations:

                1) Left Rotate
