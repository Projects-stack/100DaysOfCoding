// Binary Tree :

/*      A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each parent node can have at most two children.
    Each node of a binary tree consists of three items:
        1. data item
        2. address of left child
        3. address of right child

    Types of Binary Tree :

        1. Full Binary Tree :
                A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node
            has either two or no children.

        2. Perfect Binary Tree :
                A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes
            and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.

        3. Complete Binary Tree :
                A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences :
            1) Every level must be completely filled
            2) All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
            3) The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree does not have
             to be a full binary tree.

        4. Degenerate or Pathological Tree :
                A degenerate or pathological tree is the tree having a single child either left or right.

        5. Skewed Binary Tree :
                A skewed binary tree is a pathological/degenerate tree in which the tree is either dominated
            by the left nodes or the right nodes.
                Thus, there are two types of skewed binary tree:
                    1) left-skewed binary tree
                    2) right-skewed binary tree.

        6. Balanced Binary Tree :
                It is a type of binary tree in which the difference between the height of the left and the right subtree
            for each node is either 0 or 1.

    Binary Tree Applications

        1. For easy and quick access to data
        2. In router algorithms
        3. To implement heap data structure
        4. Syntax tree
